# Write Operation

**When**: User wants to author a new piece of documentation following Diataxis principles.

## Purpose

Guide the user through writing a single document of the correct type, using a BSI-flavored template, and validate it against type-specific guidelines.

## Execution

### Step 1: Determine Document Type

Map arguments to type:

| Argument                            | Type        |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `tutorial`                          | Tutorial    |
| `how-to`, `howto`, `guide`          | How-to      |
| `reference`, `ref`, `api`           | Reference   |
| `explanation`, `explain`, `concept` | Explanation |

If no type was provided, infer from the user's request. If still ambiguous, ask:

> What type of documentation are you writing?
>
> 1. **Tutorial** — teach a beginner through hands-on steps
> 2. **How-to guide** — solve one specific task for a practitioner
> 3. **Reference** — describe an API, config, or component factually
> 4. **Explanation** — discuss why a thing exists, the design or rationale

### Step 2: Gather Minimal Context

Ask only what's needed to start. Don't interrogate.

| Type        | Ask                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tutorial    | What will the reader build? Which package(s) does it touch? Roughly how long?       |
| How-to      | What single task does this solve? Who is the audience (FE dev, BE dev, ops, SRE)?   |
| Reference   | Which code unit (Lambda handler, CDK construct, hook, slice, config)? Read it now?  |
| Explanation | Which question / decision does this answer? Is there an OpenSpec change to link to? |

### Step 3: Determine Target Location

Decide path:

| Scope                     | Path                          |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Cross-cutting / repo-wide | `docs/<type>/`                |
| Frontend-only             | `apps/frontend/docs/<type>/`  |
| Backend-only              | `apps/backend/docs/<type>/`   |
| Specific lib              | `libs/<lib>/docs/<type>/`     |
| Specific service          | `services/<svc>/docs/<type>/` |

If the chosen target lacks a Diataxis structure, run `scaffold` first (or warn and create the single subdirectory).

### Step 3b: Check for overlap (`docs-frontmatter`)

Call `docs-frontmatter` on the target docs root. Inspect every entry's `name`, `description`, `tags`, and `kind` for topic overlap:

- If an existing doc already covers the topic and is `status: current`, **extend it** instead of creating a duplicate. Update `last_reviewed` after editing.
- If an existing doc is `deprecated` and the user wants a replacement, set the new doc's frontmatter to `authoritative: true` and link the new doc from the deprecated one.
- Only create a new file when no candidate matches.

### Step 4: Generate Filename

- kebab-case
- Type prefix only when it disambiguates (e.g. `how-to-deploy-to-dev.md`)
- Tutorials: descriptive of deliverable (`first-feature-flag.md`)
- Reference: name the entity (`cdk-constructs.md`, `pseudo-error-codes.md`)
- Explanation: name the topic or question (`why-zustand.md`, `multi-environment-strategy.md`)

### Step 5: Apply Template

Read [../references/templates.md](../references/templates.md) and use the matching template. Tailor for BSI Portal context:

- TypeScript over JavaScript in code samples
- Real `pnpm` commands, not generic `npm`
- React 18 functional components + hooks (no class components)
- AWS CDK in TypeScript for infra examples
- Refer to `@bsi-portal/<name>` packages, not invented names
- Mention `Vitest`, `Testing Library`, `aws-sdk-client-mock` where tests are relevant

#### Required frontmatter (every doc)

Every generated file MUST start with the frontmatter block defined in [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md#frontmatter-contract-every-doc-this-skill-writes). Set `kind` to the chosen Diataxis quadrant (`tutorial | how-to | reference | explanation`). See the skill for the full schema, the `runbook | onboarding | adr | api` extensions, and the concept/ADR conventions.

### Step 6: Validate

Apply the type checklist from [../references/framework.md](../references/framework.md). For each violation, warn and offer a fix:

| Type        | Check                                              | Warning                                                       |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tutorial    | No "you can also" / "alternatively" branches       | Tutorials must guide one path; move alternatives to how-to    |
| Tutorial    | Each step has a command or code block              | A step with no concrete action is probably explanation        |
| How-to      | Single task scope (one "How to …" verb)            | Split if multiple tasks                                       |
| How-to      | No multi-paragraph concept blocks                  | Move concepts to `../explanation/`                            |
| Reference   | Tables for params, no imperative ("first do …")    | Move instructions to `../how-to/`                             |
| Reference   | Format matches sibling reference docs              | Align with neighbors                                          |
| Explanation | Question or claim is stated up front               | Add framing sentence                                          |
| Explanation | At least one concrete example or diagram           | Add a snippet, diagram, or named real-world case              |

Also check repo-wide rules:

- All code blocks have language hints
- Internal links are relative
- No bare `console.log` examples in backend snippets — use `logger`
- Pseudo error codes referenced by ID, linked to the registry
- No hardcoded secrets in examples (use `process.env.X` or `<placeholder>`)

### Step 7: Format & Lint

```bash
pnpm prettier --write <new-file>
````

If the doc is referenced from a markdown index, also re-format the index.

### Step 8: Report

```
Created: <path>

Type:        <type>
Location:    <path>
Validations: <N> passed, <M> warnings (listed above)

Suggested follow-ups:
  - Link from <docs-or-package>/README.md
  - Add cross-links: <list>
  - Consider companion docs: <e.g. how-to needs an explanation>
```

## Interactive Mode

If the user pastes raw notes ("here's what I know about feature flags, write something"):

1. Decide the most useful type given the content (often Reference + a separate Explanation).
2. Propose splitting if mixed.
3. Generate one doc at a time; do not concatenate types into a single file.
