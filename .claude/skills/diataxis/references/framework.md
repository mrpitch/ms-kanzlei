# Diataxis Framework Reference

The Diataxis framework (Greek: _dia_ "across" + _taxis_ "arrangement") splits documentation into four distinct types based on user need.

## The Two Axes

- **Practical ↔ Theoretical** — does it focus on doing or on understanding?
- **Learning ↔ Working** — is the user acquiring knowledge or applying it?

## The Four Quadrants

```
                LEARNING                 WORKING
        ┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
PRACT.  │     TUTORIALS       │    HOW-TO GUIDES    │
        │  Learning-oriented  │   Task-oriented     │
        ├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
THEOR.  │    EXPLANATION      │     REFERENCE       │
        │ Understanding-ori.  │  Information-ori.   │
        └─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

## Type Details

### Tutorials — "I want to learn"

- Learning-oriented; lesson with hands-on exercises.
- Get the user to first success on a concrete deliverable.
- Minimum viable explanation; concepts go elsewhere.
- Reliable and repeatable — must be tested end-to-end.
- **Analogy:** teaching a child to cook (focus on the experience, not the dish).

**Key principles:**

- ✓ Show the destination upfront — "By the end, you'll have X"
- ✓ Deliver visible results early and often
- ✓ Maintain a narrative of expectations — "You will notice that…", "You should see…"
- ✓ Point out what learners should observe
- ✓ Focus on the concrete, not abstract
- ✓ Ruthlessly minimize explanation — link to it, don't embed it
- ✓ Encourage and permit repetition
- ✓ Ignore options and alternatives — teach one way
- ✓ Aspire to perfect reliability — every step must work as described

**Language patterns:**

- "We will…" (first-person plural, tutor-learner relationship)
- "In this tutorial, we will create…"
- "First, do X. Now, do Y."
- "The output should look something like…"
- "Notice that…", "Remember that…", "Let's check…"
- Imperatives: "Click", "Type", "Run"
- Numbered steps: 1, 2, 3

### How-to Guides — "I want to accomplish X"

- Task-oriented; series of steps to a defined outcome.
- Assumes the reader knows _what_ they want, not _how_.
- One problem per guide. Be terse.
- **Analogy:** a recipe in a cookbook.

**Key principles:**

- ✓ Goal-oriented — solve a clear, concrete problem
- ✓ Assume competence — don't teach foundational skills
- ✓ Omit the unnecessary — practical usability over completeness
- ✓ Logical sequence — steps flow as a competent user would think them
- ✓ Executable instructions — every step works; the guide is a contract
- ✓ Address real-world complexity (env differences, edge cases)
- ✓ Clear naming — title is "How to [achieve specific outcome]"

**Language patterns:**

- "This guide shows you how to…"
- "If you want X, do Y. To achieve W, do Z."
- "Refer to the X reference for full options."
- "When you encounter [situation], [action]"
- Conditional: "If X, then do Y"

### Reference — "I need to look up X"

- Information-oriented; describes the machinery factually.
- Structured around the code (functions, props, configs, constructs).
- Consistent format across siblings; comprehensive; accurate.
- Does **not** instruct or explain.
- **Analogy:** an encyclopedia entry.

**Key principles:**

- ✓ Describe and only describe — no instructions, only facts
- ✓ Neutral and objective — no opinions, no recommendations
- ✓ Precise and accurate — no approximations
- ✓ Structured by the machinery — mirror how the system is built
- ✓ Adopt standard patterns — consistent structure throughout
- ✓ Comprehensive — include all significant options and parameters
- ✓ Wholly authoritative — no doubt or ambiguity
- ✓ Examples for illustration — show without instructing

**Language patterns:**

- "X is a [noun] that [function]"
- "X inherits from Y and is defined in Z"
- "Sub-commands are: a, b, c, d"
- "Must use A. Must not apply B unless C."
- "Optional. Default: X"
- Lists and tables for comparison
- Definitions that stand alone

### Explanation — "I want to understand why"

- Understanding-oriented; discursive prose.
- Provides context, history, alternatives, trade-offs.
- Connects topics to the bigger picture.
- Does **not** instruct or describe APIs.
- **Analogy:** an article on culinary history.
- **Title pattern:** Should work with an "About …" prefix (`About our deployment model`, `Why we chose Zustand`).

**Key principles:**

- ✓ Make connections — relate to other concepts and contexts
- ✓ Provide background — design decisions, history, constraints
- ✓ Talk _about_ the subject — title should work with "About …" prefix
- ✓ Admit perspective — acknowledge limitations and alternatives
- ✓ Weigh alternatives — show why one approach was chosen
- ✓ Bound the discussion — don't absorb instructions or reference
- ✓ Answer "why" questions — not "how" or "what"

**Language patterns:**

- "The reason for X is that historically, Y…"
- "W is better than Z because…"
- "X in system Y is analogous to W in system Z. However…"
- "Some teams prefer W (because Z). This can work, but in BSI Portal…"
- "The trade-off is…"
- "An important design decision was…"
- "Historically, X…"

## Common Misclassifications

- [ ] **Accuracy verified** — for reference/explanation: facts checked against current code
- [ ] **Repo conventions** — `pnpm` not `npm`, `logger` not `console.log`, no inlined secrets
- [ ] **Formatted** — passes `pnpm prettier`
